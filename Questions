images are floated - fine?

how to get the magnifying glass in the search bar

do you guys care if we have every tuit there

tuit body for bookmarks has 60 px border from left bc image is floated - what do

hyperlink pointing to "#"

More elegant way to do the icons - seems silly to have wd-icons class just for the
sake of margin-top 12px
